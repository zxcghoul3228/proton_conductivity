# Examining proton conductivity of MOFs
This repository contains the code for the inference of neural network models used in the article "Examining proton conductivity of metal-organic frameworks by means of machine learning" [link](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/672bddbef9980725cf5b5a7f).
## Dependencies
NOTE: This code is tested on Linux with python 3.10. We used modified MOFTransformer ([link](https://github.com/hspark1212/MOFTransformer/tree/master)) in the work, so you have to install moftransformer (>=2.1.5).
## Download the pweights of models (ckpt file)
You can download the weights of models used in the work from the link.
